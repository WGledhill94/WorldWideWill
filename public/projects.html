            <p>This was my first ever challenge as part of the Web Development Course i started. My first interaction with HTML. Very basic but a good reminder of where i started out.</p>
        <li><h3><a class="link" href="./birthday-invite.html">Birthday Invite Project</a></h3></li>
            <p>Another challenge from the web course i enrolled onto. This time looking at lists & links along with adding images to web pages. Still a basic looking webpage but progress all the same. </p>
        <li><h3><a class="link" href="./Guess Number Game/index.html">Guess My Number Game</a></h3></li>
            <p>This was a JavaScript challenge, as part of a different course that was dedicate to JavaScript, the HTML & CSS was provided so in stages the aim was to make the page functional. <br /><br />

            It's a simple game where you guess a number between 1 and 10. You have 20 tries to get it right. It has the ability to track your highscore as well as editing the CSS to change the background green if you win the game. <br/><br/>

            The interactive features of this game were built using DOM/DOM Manipulation. A really interesting part of JavaScript but a little tricky to get the hang of. I also started learning about refactoring code during this stage of my learning. The JavaScript i started with was way to long originally and very repetitive so with the use of function to display messaging and scores etc. Feel free to inspect the code after clicking the link. Still a working in progress but a good way to see some beginner coding.
