                    My primary area of work was SAP & Finance testing, delivering on two major finance projects.
                    I have also been given smaller projects at short notice and delivered successful results without issue.<br />
                    Being handed a project with very little knowledge and delivering end to end (Test Planning to Test Summary) is testament to my pragmatic and can-do attitude.<br />
                    I have worked with third party suppliers as well as key business stakeholders to enable me to get an understanding of different systems and software.
